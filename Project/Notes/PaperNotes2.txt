Notes
-----

> Intensity (loudness)
> F0 (Fundamental Frequency) mean
> Variability
> Range
> High Frequency Content / Energy of speech


"Findings confirm that paramters related to F0 and spectral distribution are important cues to affective speech content"

"More recently, amplitude, pitch & spectral profile (tilt, balance, distribution)"

"It is show there, that spectral flux has the overall best corelation for a single feature" [related to arousal?]

What are cepstral parameters? (Mel-Frequency-Cepstral-Coefficients - MFCC)

Paralinguistic?

((Why the parameters were chosen))
1) the potential of an acoustic parameter to index physiological changes in voice production during affective processes
2) the frequency and success with which the parameter has been used in the past literature
3) its theoretical significance.


Discrete Cosine Transformation?


Minimalistic Paramter Set (See MPS.txt)

Harmonic?
Formant?
Individual Pitch Periods?
