Dear all
You are probably already aware that you have to produce a short progress report by Friday the 18th of December.
 
The report must be at most three pages long and cover the following (four P's):
 
- Project Description: clear description of the project, i.e. what it is that has to be done
- Progress: what you have achieved as of time of writing
- Plan: a detailed plan of work, with deliverables,  for the remainder of the project
- Problems: any difficulties that you foresee or have experienced
 
You must email this as a pdf to your supervisor and to me. Put in the Subject: of your email "Level 4 Progress Report".
 
Cheers
 
Patrick
